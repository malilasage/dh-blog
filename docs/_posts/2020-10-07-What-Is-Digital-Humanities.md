1. What is digital humanities? Digital humanities is an ever-changing field of study. Because of the constant growth and change the definition of what Digital Humanitites means is always evolving. But what is it? According Burdick,

   > "Digital Humanities is born of the encounter between traditional humanities and computational methods. With the migration of cultural materials into networked environments, questions regarding the production, availability, validity, and stewardship of these materials present new challenges and opportunities for humanists. In contrast with most traditional forms of scholarship, digital approaches are conspicuously collaborative and generative, even as they remain grounded in the traditions of humanistic inquiry. This changes the culture of humanities work as well as the questions that can be asked of the materials and objects that comprise the humanistic corpus" (Burdick et al. 2012)

2. What is the point? Digital Humanities brings together a community of people from many different fields to further expand the possibilities of the field of Humanities as stated by

   > “Building on earlier generations of computational approaches to humanities research—with emphasis on the creation, preservation, and inter-pretation of the cultural record—the Digital Humanities has greatly expanded the potential power and reach of the humanities disciplines, both within the academy, and, just as importantly, outside its walls.” (Burdick et al. 2012)

3.  The process of continuously updating and iterating, common in technology, lends itself to the Digital Humanities idea of "thinking-through-practice" (Burdick et al. 2012, 13). This makes room for consistent progress and improvement.

4. The work done by libraries, museums, and other cultural institutions to create digital databases of records and historical information allows anyone with an internet connection to access that information (Burdick et al. 2012, 8). This aggregation of data in tandem with a constantly improving ability to process data makes it possible to investigate further and follow new lines of inquiry that weren't visible before.

5. The open-source nature of many of these databases and tools make it possible to create tangible and accessible ways of interacting with the information. It is no longer neccessary to go through the process of gaining physical access to historical documents, or even to search through endless spreadsheets. Through Digital Humanities, we have the ability to visualize and analyze data, and to create platforms for others to do the same.<br>
