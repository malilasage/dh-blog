1. What is digital humanities? **Digital humanities is an ever-changing field of study.** Because of the constant growth and change the definition of what Digital Humanities means is always evolving. But what is it? According to Burdick,

   > "Digital Humanities is born of the encounter between traditional humanities and computational methods. With the migration of cultural materials into networked environments, questions regarding the production, availability, validity, and stewardship of these materials present new challenges and opportunities for humanists. In contrast with most traditional forms of scholarship, digital approaches are conspicuously collaborative and generative, even as they remain grounded in the traditions of humanistic inquiry. This changes the culture of humanities work as well as the questions that can be asked of the materials and objects that comprise the humanistic corpus"

2. **Digital Humanities brings together a community of people** from many different fields to further expand the possibilities of the field of Humanities as stated by

   > “Building on earlier generations of computational approaches to humanities research—with emphasis on the creation, preservation, and interpretation of the cultural record—the Digital Humanities has greatly expanded the potential power and reach of the humanities disciplines, both within the academy, and, just as importantly, outside its walls.”

3. The process of **continuously updating and iterating**, common in technology, lends itself to the Digital Humanities idea of "thinking-through-practice" (Burdick et al. 2012, 13). This makes room for consistent progress and improvement with each iteration, and the incorporation of version control softwares can provide a detailed and transparent history of this progress.

4. The work done by libraries, museums, and other cultural institutions to **create digital databases** of records and historical information allows anyone with an internet connection to access that information (Burdick et al. 2012, 8). This aggregation of data in tandem with a constantly improving ability to process data makes it possible to investigate further and follow new lines of inquiry that weren't visible before.

5. The open-source nature of many of these databases and tools make it possible to create tangible and **accessible** ways of interacting with the information. It is no longer necessary to go through the process of gaining physical access to historical documents, or even to search through endless spreadsheets. Through Digital Humanities, we have the ability to visualize and analyze data, and to create platforms for others to do the same.

6. The ability to use software also makes **visualizing and compiling data easier**. Instead of having to write down and create maps and charts by hand, they can be done much cleaner and easier with the help of computer technology. Looking at the interesting maps and graphs in chapter one of Nathan Yau’s “Data Points” shows the great ability of digital maps and graphs to display information with accuracy and clarity.

7. **Digital humanities is growing** and computer science is coming to the forefront of the scientific world. In the opinion of Warren Sack, computer science is becoming a leader of science like philosophy and mathematics were in their time. Computer science is needed not just for digital humanities, but also for many other fields. And the world is beginning to accept computer science as a science, with schools and universities having computer science programs.

8. **There are still problems with digital humanities and computer science that you should care about.** For example, gender diversity. Only fourteen percent of graduates in computer scene programs in the United States were women (Sack 2019, 7). A problem pertaining more to digital humanities is biases in record taking. An example from Michel-Rolph Trouillot in his book “Silencing the Past”, is the story of the Alamo. The story is glorified in history as a tale of bravery, even though recently people think that it was not like that. An example from another country is the Primary Chronicle of Russia, which tries not to make Russia look weak at all. The Primary Chronicle tells us that the Rus had a trading relationship with the Mongols, even though the Rus were actually heavily taxed and burdened by them after the Mongol conquest (which the Primary Chronicle pretends doesn’t happen). It also tells the Battle of Kulikovo as a huge victory in Russian history, even though it was very insignificant. We should care about these two examples of bias, and the apparent issue gender discrimination in digital humanities and computer science, so we do not make the same mistakes as historians and recorders in the past did.

9. Besides being aware of past mistakes by record takers, you should also be aware of the four concepts of **curation, analysis, editing, and modeling** to help understand digital humanities. “Curation is the selection and organization of materials in an interpretive framework, argument, or exhibit,” (Burdick et al. 2012, 19). This is a word you have probably heard in the same sentence as “museum”; they curate things. With the ability to use digital methods, new forms of curation can be used. Analysis is the processing of text or data, (Burdick et al. 2012, 19). This goes along with data visualization, which is becoming more important with the ability to use digital technology. Analysis and data visualization work together to “give graphical legibility to analytical results,” (Burdick et al. 2012 p. 19). Editing is important in making sense of and verifying cultural records. Editing is also a creative tool used to construct arguments, (Burdick et al. 2012, 19). Lastly, modeling is the structuring of digital projects. Modeling varies from project to project, depending on “cultural contents” (Burdick et al. 2012, 19).

10. The last thing to know about digital humanities is **who, what, where, when, why, and how**. These are the things a detective asks on a cheesy cop show, but it is something someone in digital humanities must ask when looking at records. The answers to the who, what, where, when, why, and how questions is data about the data. This is called metadata, (Yau 2013, 27). Metadata can provide important context about the numbers you are looking at. Your friend could tell you that the city of Lacey was named after Lacey Evans. But if you take into the account the context of *who* the information is coming from, your friend from Indiana who has never been to Lacey and is a big wrestling fan, you would learn not to take his data about Lacey seriously, and move on. If you learn that the city of Lacey was named after a man named O.C. Lacey, a prominent figure in the early years of the town, and that information is from the Lacey Museum, it is credible information to use if you are doing a project on etymology. That is an example of how metadata is important in processing data.<br>
