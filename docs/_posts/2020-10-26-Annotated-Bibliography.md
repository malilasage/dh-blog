This annotation is in the Chicago style for ‘“Pretends he can read’: Runaways and Literacy in Colonial America, 1730—1776”, by Antonio T. Bly from “Early American Studies Vol. 6, No. 2”. It discusses the literacy and lifestyle of slaves and free blacks during the 1700s/ It compares different areas of the 13 colonies and how the literacy and lifestyle differed. It also gave possible reasons for slaves escaping, like the Stamp Act. There are also tables showing the literacy rates, number of slaves, archaeological records, and other things.

The source looks reliable. It is from 2008, so it is a little old, but the author uses many citations, and shows first hand evidence of news clippings and archaeological finds. The author had taught history at Appalachian State University, and now studies New England runaway slaves at Sacramento State, which gives me confidence in the quality of the source.

This is a helpful resource because if we choose to go down the slave route, it gives numbers of slaves and runaways, as well as possible reasons for slaves running away.

Provides background on how slavery was established in the American Colonies, but focuses on the time period immediately prior to our data set.

The authors begin by discussing the limitations of using estate inventories as research data, going into specifics about the limitations of the York County Probate Records. They then discuss property and inheritance rights of women during the 1700s, and make observations on potential unwritten rules that governed those rights. The essay concludes that gender does in fact influence the accuracy of  these estate records, though it is difficult to draw many concrete conclusions given the difficulties of working with estate records as a primary data source.

It first describes how the parish was organized, and how it was the main center of “government” for people. It then describes how the parish was formed, the demographics, physical and political geography, and the lives of men, women, leaders, and blacks. At the end there are many tables with things like birth and death rates, marriages, disappearances, and many other things.

This was copyrighted in 1992, so it is possible new information has been acquired about the subject matter since then. The author is a professor at William and Mary University so I don’t see any problems with that. The paper wants to explain the importance and life of Charles Parish, and it may be biased in the way the importance of a Parish is stated, the tables and other information have no bias.

The amount of tables about the parish and the county will be very useful to our project, no matter what we choose, because there is so much information. The rest of the paper provides good context about the area too.

The author summarizes the social background of Charles Parish, York County. Richter covers the importance of a strong social support network, social norms surrounding marriage and childbirth, and the roles women played in legal and political matters.

This annotation in Chicago style is for “The Many Faces of Native Bonded Labor in Colonial Virginia” by Kristalyn Marie Shefveland, cited above. It discusses Virginians attitudes toward slavery, mostly of Native Americans. The Virginians attitudes are changing; they first, in the early 1600s, din’t know if Native Americans should be slaves or servants, then most seemed to have an attitude that they should be able to have Native American children as slaves (even if the law prevented it), but adults could be servants. By the mid-1600's a ‘permit’ was required to have a servant to prevent slavery. By the 1670’s, it was more acceptable for Native Americans to be slaves, and the law followed this. However in 1863 Native American slavery was completely banned, but this law was not completely obeyed. It was still acceptable in the commoners eyes. Finally in the early 1700’s, all slavery was legal. The article also discusses the methods in which Virginians got their Native American slaves.

This source from 2014 seems reliable. It has quotes from the actual people and laws involved, and resources she used look reliable too. The author is a professor that teaches about the American South, and Native American relationships with settlers, which gives me more confidence that this is a good source.

This source discusses things before the time period we are provided with in the dataset, but it gives good context and history to things happening in our time period.

Through the lens of feminist and queer theory, the author explores laws and cultural norms surrounding race, slavery, and status in Colonial Virginia.

This annotation is for Slave Voyages done in the Chicago style. It is website that gives data and information about the Atlantic slave trade. The information it gives is about the numbers of slaves being taken from one area, and how many of those will end up in another. This is shown with simple maps. The website also has databases which gives the starting point of a ship, place where the slaves were purchased, the end destination. There are also graphs and tables to show how the amount of slaves being transported changed over time.

There is no author given for this source, but it is copyrighted by Emory University, so I do not have any problems with the legitimacy of the information. It was also copyrighted in 2019, so it is up to date. The website wants to educate about the slave trade, and it is not a very scholarly setup, but is does seem unbiased.

This source will be useful if we focus on slaves because it can provide data about how many slaves came to the area we are focusing on.
