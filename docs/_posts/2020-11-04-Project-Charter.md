### York County Estate Records

The dataset we are studying is probate records of York County, Virginia from the years 1700-1800. These are interesting records because of things going on during the period, like the industrial revolution and the American Revolution, as well as a smallpox epidemic. These records do not represent all members of the population, as inventories were often ordered for very wealthy people, people in debt, or people whose inventories were questionable for some reason. However, the records are still very valuable, as most other estate records from the colonial period in Virginia were destroyed during the American Civil War. The people doing the appraisals were supposed to be unbiased, but the appraisers were often neighbors of the deceased, and are a potential source of bias. We looked at the records after they had been collected and used by Wendy Lucas and Noel Campbell for their essay “Unwritten Rules and Gendered Frames Amongst Probate Appraisers? Evidence From 18th Century York County Virginia” published in “Essays in Economic & Business History” published in 2018. They sought to find out if there was bias concerning female involvement in the estates. To help with their research, they made several different item categories including gender-neutral possessions (farm animals, chests and trunks, chamber pots), and items belonging to a man's world (razors, hunting equipment, men's clothes) or a woman's world(sewing, spinning, laundry). In an attempt to remove class and gender bias, many of these categories represent common items that most people would have, and that would have been available at accessible price points. Since the actual records are written very inconsistently, we hope to use the item categories provided to us by Campbell and Lucas to identify if certain item categories are more prevalent or missing in certain people in the probate, neither the poorest third of the data set, women, or location, and if this changes over time.

### Goal

Using York County, VA estate records from 1700-1800, we hope to discover and explain what isn't present (or isn't recorded) in people's homes. If items appear to be systemically omitted from the records, this would pose ramifications for those using estate records to study the material culture of the past without acknowledging these systemic omissions.

### Research Questions

What did the least wealthy third of those in our records survive on, and how did that change from 1700 to 1800?

- How well do the estate records represent the lower economic classes?   
<br />

Why are some 'necessary' items frequently missing from the records?

- From 'Unwritten Rules', we know that there are several possible answers to this question. Items could be 'reserved' for the use of widows or children, and items were sometimes unintentionally overlooked by the appraisers due to gender bias. It is also possible that the deceased simply did not own those items, but we feel that is an inadequate explanation in the case of items like chamber pots or clothing.

What characteristics are shared by the people who were missing several categories of ubiquitous items?

- This will likely trend towards the bottom segment of wealth, but given the conclusions drawn by Campbell and Lucas, it seems possible that this could strongly correlate to gender.

Are there items that only show up in certain time periods or for certain groups of people?

- 'Unwritten Rules' notes that there is a significant rise in the prevalence of domestic spinning equipment during the century, which they attribute to the abandonment of tobacco production resulting in an increased amount of female labor available. We plan to look for other similar trends present in the data and investigate what events in the community may have impacted possession.

### Methodology

Much of the legwork necessary to analyze the estate records has been done by Lucas and Campbell, and we hope to build on what they have accomplished. The initial digital transcription of the records by the Colonial Williamsburg Foundation made the estate records more accessible and readable, and from those transcriptions, Lucas and Campbell produced a single dataset that includes economic data, item categories, and other attributes extrapolated from the records, making analysis of the records significantly easier. In the transition from transcripts to spreadsheet, some records were repeats or had sustained damage, and were left out from the dataset we have now. Though the Colonial Williamsburg transcripts include the names of the appraisers, they were also omitted from our data.

We would like to extend their work by adding new dimensions to the data and using visual tools to unearth new areas of interest. The records contain very few, non-specific, variables for location, and the irregularities in formatting and spelling of the items themselves are additional limiting factors. We hope to circumvent some of these issues through text analysis, and possibly provide more precise location data by cross-referencing our existing data with historical reports from the Colonial Williamsburg library.

### Tools

Data Visualizations

- **Palladio:** how the items relate within different economic classes and time periods
- **d3.js:** visualize trends of different items over time and related events, what items are expected to be present in the average home vs what items are recorded
- **esri/GoogleMaps:** demographics over the county

Data Manipulation

- **Excel**
- **OpenRefine**
