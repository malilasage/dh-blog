### Goal

Using York County, VA estate records from 1700-1800, we hope to discover and explain what isn't present (or isn't recorded) in people's homes.   
<br />

### Research Questions

What did the least wealthy survive on, and did that change over the century?

Why are some 'necessary' items frequently missing from the records? (ex: chamber pots, clothing)

Who had the most absent categories of items?

Items that show up only in certain time periods?   
<br />

### Methodology

Identify the records pertinent to our questions (lowest wealth based on estate, records with least amount of ubiquitous items), and the frequency of ubiquitous items over time. Using these records, we plan to investigate any trends that emerge from those items and the associated social and economic data. We would also like to convert the currency in the data (pennise sterling) to USD, to simplify the interpretation of our data visualizations. We have also found that the formatting of our data (a binary 1/0 to indicate the presence or absence of an item category) is not suited to some types of visualization and analysis. While this makes some tasks more straightforward, we expect to do a substantial amount of data manipulation and reformatting.

If time allows, we would like to extend the data by adding categories for non-ubiquitous items to the records (such as leisure, religion, and slaves), and provide more precise location data by cross referencing our existing data with historical reports from the Colonial Williamsburg library.
