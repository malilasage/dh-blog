We interviewed Wendy Lucas. She, along with Noel Campbell, compiled the data set we are using for our project, and wrote *“Unwritten Rules and Gendered Frames Amongst Probate Appraisers? Evidence from Eighteenth-Century York County, Virginia”* in “Essays in Economic & Business History”. We emailed her and scheduled a zoom meeting, and talked for a little more than a half-hour. We also recorded the interview with her permission. We asked her various questions and she sent us some resources via email afterward.

Dr. Lucas was very enthusiastic about her project and data, and was really happy to talk to us and help. She said she is excited to see where our project goes and would like to help again if we needed her.
Our main goals with the interview were to learn more about the behind the scenes of the project, and to hopefully get some inspiration for what we wanted to do. We also wanted to clarify information about the data set with her. We first asked her why she wanted to do this project, and she said that she is interested in material culture. She explained how she liked to go through these old records and how it was fun to see all these different items from the past (she said later that George Washington’s probate is one of the most interesting she’s seen). Then we asked her how she came up with the research question. She explained how she just looked for patterns in the data to see if there were changes over time. She said how she would see differences in how things were described, like a super detailed description for an item, and a very vague one, and the question she kept coming back to was “Why am I seeing a difference?”. She also said how she was surprised by things she didn’t see, and how she derived questions from that.

We also asked her how she got past inconsistencies with the data set, and how there were different words for the same items and things like that. She said she would search for the beginning of the word, and then look up different known spellings and synonyms for a word they were looking for. Then we asked if she noticed if there were any “unspoken rules” for groups besides women, which was basically a no. After that, we asked if she paid any attention to the geography of the data set. She explained how they coded for rural and urban to see if they could see any patterns from that. She then told us how there was a way, if we wanted, we could get more specific geographic locations from the Williamsburg research website, which was pretty useful. The last question we asked her was if she used any data visualizations, to see if we could compare ideas. This didn’t help because they did not use any data visualizations in their project.

We said our goodbyes and things, and she emailed us some resources after the interview. The interview was helpful in getting information and techniques, and it was fun to see her enthusiasm for her own project and for ours. While we aren't sure how exactly we are going to use the information she provided, we do look forward to seeing her again if we need any more help.
