The data set we chose is the “York County probate records 1700-1800”. It shows the estates of some people in the county. There are 694 people whose estates were accounted for between 1700 and 1800. The data was collected for probate, or to prove a person's will when they died so it could be distributed to their heirs. To take inventory of the person’s possessions, the person who petitioned to begin the probate process would hire some individuals to appraise the estate and record all of the belongings of the person who died. This data would be put into a ‘probate packet’. After the items were appraised, there would be an auction for the items, (“U.S. Probate Records Class Handout” 2015).

The people who collected the data were meant to be unbiased. However, the website that we downloaded the data from believed this might not be the case. Wendy Lucas and Noel Campbell believed that the deceased person’s gender may have had an impact on how the appraisers conducted their probate. According to Lucas and Cambell from 2016:

> “If society drew a distinction between a man’s world and his work and a woman’s world and her work, then it may have associated different goods with the different worlds. This could have created ‘men’s possessions’ and ‘women’s possessions,’ ascribing gender to material objects. Acting within this set of cultural assumptions, probate appraisers might have wittingly or unwittingly inventoried estates differently on the basis of female involvement with the estate.”

Seeing this in the website we downloaded the data from could give us the question of if this was true. Also, according to the Colonial Williamsburg website, the appraisers were usually neighbors of the person that had died. This would make it harder for the appraisals to be unbiased, and personal issues may come into play. Can we tell if there is bias from looking at the data?

Other question we could ask is what was the prevalence of slavery in this society? Black people, (the records refer to the slaves as Negroes, and sometimes lists their names) are viewed as possessions in this data set. Other questions could have to do with the actual price of the items. For example, would a chair in 1700 cost the same as a chair in 1800. Did prices go up or down during these 100 years? Going back to the conversation about gender, were items of women appraised any differently than the items of a man?

Unfortunately, the appraised prices are not always listed, but we could use the amount of items a person has. Every entry tells us how much of an item there was. There are also describing words, which could be problematic. One example is “an old frying pan”. What is the measure of something being old? That could depend on the person appraising the item. One frying pan may be old to one appraiser, but not to another. That is one of the problems in the data.

Another problem with people appraising the items is what price they value an item. Not many items in this list have prices attached to them, but it is still an interesting thought. One appraiser might value a desk at 10 pounds, another may value it at 15. Perhaps an appraiser may overprice an item, and no one could afford it at the auction. They could underprice it and the family could lose out on money. One thing that is sad to think about but should be thought about, is the value placed on slaves. And not just the comparison between multiple appraisers, but the same one. Sometimes two negro men will be in the same row, indicating that they are valued the same. Others are not though. Richard Burt had four Negro men, one named Tom, another Daniel, another Will, and last but not least one named Finne. They are listed in separate rows, indicating that they have different prices. How is a negro man judged? How are they valued? It is a depressing question but the answers could be there may be a personal bias brought into valuing another human being. Richard Burt also had a negro woman named Peg, and three girls named Lucy, Rachel, and Kate, (all listed in separate rows). One of the men could be married to Peg, and those could be his children. Will the family be separated, or will they be bought together? Other people have some slaves listed in the same row, Like John Burdett who had “Bell, a Negro woman & two children”. Since they are listed in the same row, that implies they would come as a package, unlike Richard Burt’s slaves. Or is this just a result of how the appraiser wrote down the data? One appraiser may have a different style or method of taking information than another.

In conclusion there are many questions to be asked about the data, and the legitimacy of how it was compiled.<br>
